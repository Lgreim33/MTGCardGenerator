Run the programs in order: fetch_bulk_data.py, get_card_feats.py, preprocess.py, data_split.py, train.py, test.py, then demo.py
If you clone the repo you should have them already, but make sure you have Data, Dictionaries, List_To_Singles, Models, and SplitData subdirectories within your main project directory
Within the Data subforlder, include another Subfolder called Types
To run the demo with text generation, you will need an API key for hugging face, simply paste it in once you are prompted
While you are meant to run the code to obtain the dataset this is the link to the scryfall API documentation: https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data
